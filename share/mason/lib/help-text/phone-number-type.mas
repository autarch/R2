  Each phone has a type, which lets you distinguish between things like home
  and cell numbers. A phone number type can apply to people, organizations,
  and/or households. For example, a type of "Home" or "Mobile" does not make
  sense for an organization, and a type of "Office" doesn't make sense for
  people or households.
