  Each phone has a type, which lets you distinguish between things
  like home and cell numbers. A phone number type can apply to people,
  organizations, and/or households. For example, a type of "Home" or
  "Cell" does not make sense for an organization, and a type of
  "Switchboard" doesn't make sense for people or households.
