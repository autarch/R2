  Donation campaigns allows you to categorize donations based on what the
  donation is for. This may be used to earmark specific donations, as well as
  to record that a donation came about because of a specific action
  (fundraising event, letter, etc.).

  For smaller organizations with simpler funding models this won't be
  necessary, and you can use a single "General Fund" for all donations.
