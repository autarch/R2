      This allows you to keep track of where donations came from, at
      whatever granularity you want. For most organizations, it may be
      best to keep these sources broad, like "mail" and
      "online". Other organizations may prefer to track things in much
      greater detail in order to evaluate the success of specific
      campaigns.

    <p>
      This allows you to earmark donations for specific
      funds. However, for many organizations this won't be necessary,
      and you can simply mark all donations as targeted towards a
      general fund.

    <p>
      For most organizations, the defaults of "cash", "check", "credit
      card", and "in-kind" are probably sufficient.
