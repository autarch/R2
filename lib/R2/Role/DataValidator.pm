# This doesn't work so well when we're trying to create a bunch of
# objects in one transaction, either from a controller or model. A
# good model example is Person, which tries to create a Contact
# internally.
#
# What we want is to capture all the validation errors for all the
# objects, but as it is the first class to fail validation will abort
# all further processing.
#
# This is tricky to solve, especially since a failure to create object
# A may make it impossible to create object B, but we'd still like to
# validate B's data as much as possible.
#
# Maybe the solution is to expose the validation via public methods
# and have the controller do all the validations up front?
