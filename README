If you want to get started by playing with Rapport, you need to
install some stuff first.

First, you'll need to install a whole bunch of Perl modules. Make sure
you have a modern version of the CPAN.pm module, as this will make
installation much simpler. You'll also need Module::Build from CPAN:

 > cpan Module::Build

One of them is not on CPAN (sorry) and lives in my SVN repo at
https://svn.urth.org/svn/Catalyst-DR/trunk

 > svn export https://svn.urth.org/svn/Catalyst-DR/trunk Catalyst-DR
 > cd Catalyst-DR
 > cpan .

Now go back to the R2 checkout.

 > perl Build.PL
 > cpan `./Build missing`

The "./Build missing" command returns a space-separated list of all
the prereqs you are missing.

You will also need a reasonably modern version of Postgres (I'm using
8.3, but 8.1+ should work, I think). I'll leave installing that up to
you.

 > cd R2
 > ./bin/dev/init-dev-env

This will recreate the Postgres schema. You must run this as a user
who can create a database in Postgres. It will create a new "R2"
database owned by the current user.

It will also create some test data so you can login as a new user. The
init-dev-env script will tell you about these users at the end of the
script.

The last step is to start the dev server:

 > ./bin/r2_server -r -d

This starts a local single-process web server in debugging mode. Once
it's ready, it will tell you the URI you can use to see the
application.
